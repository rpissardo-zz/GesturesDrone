# GesturesDrone


The system is simple. First of all you must have and Arduino Mega 2560 (with other, must change servo ports)
After that, connect all cable into Drone's Gilbal. In this example, we used onle 2 Dofs.
Then you must connect your Arduino to your Pc and look for port ID. Chage the port ID into the Python code. Then Execute.

Important: I must have a plan and clean mono-color backgroud. 

:D 

Thanks
